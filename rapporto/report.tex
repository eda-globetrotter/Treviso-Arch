%	Abstract

\begin{abstract} 
This report provides an introduction into processor architecture (or microarchitecture) design. Four common microarchitecture designs are covered in this report are: single-cycle processors, multi-cycle processors, pipelined processors, and superscalar processors. A description of how to design the datapath and control path of these processor architectures is provided. In addition, a performance comparison of the aforementioned microarchitectures is provided.
