\section{Introduction to Processor Architecture}
\label{sec:ProcessorArchitecture}

In this section, I provide the motivation to write a report on processor architecture, and introduction to processor architecture. \\
\ \\
Current and emerging trends in ``Big Data'' \cite{BilbaoOsorio2014,Wedewer2013}, Internet of Things \cite{Witchalls2013}, and cyber-physical systems \cite{PCAST2013} drives a need for energy-efficient computing. From mobile devices to high-performance super computing, the cost of power and cooling these computers have become so dominant that they have become a barrier to improving the performance of computers \cite{Hennessy2012,Fuller2011}. Without better computers, it can be harder for companies to sell computers to consumers and enterprises. Furthermore, computer architecture is a difficult subject to teach, especially at the undergraduate level \cite{Yurcik2002}. Due to the demand for high-performance, energy-efficient processors \cite{Duranton2013}, we need to train more highly-skilled computer engineering students to pursue a career in the field of computer architecture. In addition, before students and professionals can tackle grand challenges in computer architecture \cite{Track2014}, they need to master the basics of modern processor design. \\

Processor architecture refers to the structure and organization of the computer chip (or processor), including the set of instructions that it can comprehend \cite{Hennessy2012}. The study of this is critical to designing faster computers, reducing energy consumption of computers, and improving the reliability of computers. It also defines the hardware and software interface \cite{Patterson2014}, so that engineers designing computer hardware and software developers can collaborate or work independently to create compelling products for customers and end users.

\section{Description of the Report}
\label{sec:DescriptionoftheReport}

In this section, a structure for the report is described. In Subsection \ref{ssec:AudienceandPurpose}, we specify the audience and purpose of the report proposal and the report. Following that in Subsection \ref{ssec:TentativeOutline}, we provide a tentative outline of the report. Lastly, in Subsection \ref{ssec:PreliminaryBibliography}, we provide a preliminary bibliography for the report.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Audience and Purpose}
\label{ssec:AudienceandPurpose}

The sole audience of the report proposal and a primary audience for the report is Prof. Richard McGuire. Secondary audience for the report would include my peers and myself, who can use the report to help them review the basics of processor architecture for their classes on computer architecture. We (my peers and myself) can also use the report to help us prepare for the Ph.D. qualifying examination, or equivalent, and for job interviews. Tertiary audience would include undergraduates who want to learn about processor architecture design, so that they can engage in undergraduate research projects and consider going to graduate school or pursue an engineering career in computer architecture. Since processor architecture is poorly taught in many universities, this is important in the context of broadening participation of not-so-privileged students in processor architecture.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Tentative Outline}
\label{ssec:TentativeOutline}

A tentative outline for the structure of the report is given as follows, with annotations to describe the importance and relevance of each section.

\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item Introduction. {\it This section introduces processor architecture, and basic concepts in processor architecture (or  microarchitecture) and some background information.}
\item Single-cycle processor. {\it This section describes how to design the most basic type of processor architecture}
\item Multi-cycle processor. {\it This section describes a faster microarchitecture, which allocates multiple clock cycles for each instruction.}
\item Pipelined processor. {\it This section describes an even faster microarchitecture based on the notion of pipelining.}
\item Out-of-order pipelined processor. {\it This section describes a microarchitecture that rearranges instructions of a computer program to improve performance.}
\item Out-of-order superscalar processor. {\it This section addresses contemporary microarchitectures by issuing multiple instructions per clock cycle to improve performance.}
\item Conclusion. {\it This section concludes the report by summarizing the basic concepts in processor architecture and providing some directions for more advanced work in processor architecture.}
\end{enumerate}

%\ \\
%This book covers the basics of computer organization without too much technical details and rigor. However, it is highly superficial in describing the microarchitecture of processors. Therefore, it is difficult to design and implement the microarchitecture of a processor, without referring to better books on processor architecture.

\item Rajeev Balasubramonian and Norman P. Jouppi and Naveen Muralimanohar, ``Multi-Core Cache Hierarchies,'' Synthesis Lectures on Computer Architecture series, Morgan \& Claypool Publishers, San Rafael, CA, November, 2011. \\
\ \\
This book covers advanced material on hierarchical cache design for multi-core processors. However, it does not provide the basics for simple cache design for single-core/uni- processors. It also does not cover other topics in processor architecture design. Given its brevity on advanced topics, lack of examples, and lack of exercises (or problem sets) to help us learn concepts, I do consider it as a primary resource for architecture resource. That said, it is a helpful secondary resource for advanced topics in multi-core processors.

%\ \\
%It covers the basics of processor architecture, such as: Flynn's taxonomy for classifying processor architectures, pipelined processor architectures, and component design for each pipelined stage of a simple microarchitecture design. However, this monograph is lacking in implementation details for the design of a processor architecture. It also does not have worked examples nor problems to help us learn.

\section{Project Plan}
\label{sec:ProjectPlan}

This section introduces how the project of writing my report shall be planned. In Subsection \ref{ssec:TasksandMethods}, I would discuss the tasks and subtasks that need to be completed to finish writing my report, and the methods that I would use to complete the tasks. This subsection would also include milestones that need to be completed. Subsequently, in Subsection \ref{ssec:Schedule}, I would discuss the schedule for the milestones of this report writing process. Lastly, in Subsection \ref{ssec:RiskManagement}, risk management is carried out to determine the risks involved in the report writing process.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Tasks and Methods}
\label{ssec:TasksandMethods}

The tasks of writing the report would include some literature review of the books regarding computer architecture, as well as going over worked examples and solving exercises in the textbook to help me improve my knowledge of processor architecture design. It also includes designing a processor to test my concepts in processor architecture, and running processor simulators to examine how would changing the parameters of a processor affect its performance and power consumption. For the primary concepts involved in design processors, I would include a section to describe them in my report. \\
\ \\
The aforementioned tasks and proposed methods to accomplish these tasks are listed below. \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item Literature review of some books about computer architecture
%\item Comprehend worked examples and solve exercises in textbooks to help me improve my knowledge of processor architecture design. I shall cover the following on the following topics: %\vspace{-0.3cm}
%	\begin{enumerate} %\itemsep -2pt
%	\item Single-cycle processor
%	\item Multi-cycle processor
%	\item Pipelined processor
%	\item Out-of-order pipelined processor
%	\item Out-of-order superscalar processor
%	\end{enumerate}
%\item Designing a processor to test my concepts in processor architecture
%\item Running processor simulators to examine how would changing the parameters of a processor affect its performance and power consumption
\item Single-cycle processor section
\item Multi-cycle processor section
\item Pipelined processor section
\item Out-of-order pipelined processor section
\item Out-of-order superscalar processor section
\item Report writing
\item Progress report
\item Review drafts of report
\end{enumerate}

Progress reports are due according to dates set in the course syllabus, but are subject to be rescheduled upon the recommendation of the course instructor, Prof. Richard McGuire. Drafts for my report, segmented by sections can be completed and reviewed by my peers. Completing drafts on schedule, as indicated in Figure \ref{fig:ganttchart}, would enable me to stay on track and mitigate the risk of having to complete the report in rush just before the deadline. Each section shall be completed with a write-up for that section, so that the report would be a concatenation of these sections. For the each section, I shall comprehend worked examples from the textbooks and solve exercises in them. For the single-cycle processor and pipelined processor, I would simulate them with processor simulators and design them as integrated circuits. These activities would help me explain the basics of processor architecture better.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Schedule}
\label{ssec:Schedule}

In this section, I briefly describe the schedule for the report writing process. In Figure \ref{fig:ganttchart}, the Gantt chart shows the schedule for managing my report writing process. It indicates that the time frame in which I expect to complete the main tasks of the report. Since the concepts for single-cycle processors, multi-cycle processors, and pipelined processors are easier than out-of-order pipelined processors and out-of-order superscalar processors, I would cover these material in a week each. As for out-of-order pipelined processors and out-of-order superscalar processors, I need more time to elaborate the details involved in designing these modern processor architectures. Hence, I have set aside two weeks for each of these sections.

%\subsection{Roles and Personal Qualifications}
%\label{ssec:RolesandPersonalQualifications}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Risk Management}
\label{ssec:RiskManagement}

A major risk to writing a good report for the class would include not being able to obtain experimental results from the processor design projects. If I cannot adequately test the designs by simulating them, I cannot verify if my processor designs are correct. In addition, I need to be able to find good samples of simple computer programs to test my processor design(s), so that I can use them as examples to explain the intricacies of modern processors. I would mitigate this risk by using very small snippets of computer programs that are used in my computer architecture classes to test my processors and demonstrate certain concepts. In addition, a minor risk to the project would be lost of data and text that I have written till date. I am addressing this risk by using an online repository (i.e., {\it Bitbucket}), based on cloud computing, to store various versions and modifications of my report and relevant class material (e.g., project proposal).




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Summary and Recommendation}
\label{sec:SummaryRecommendation}

This proposal summaries what report I would write, why is this report important, what I plan to do for my report writing process, and project management issues for writing this report. \\
\ \\
I strongly recommend that Prof. Richard McGuire approve this report proposal.
